Throughout the evaluation period, I placed great emphasis on completing all mandatory trainings promptly, both for myself and my team members. By ensuring timely completion of these trainings, we maintained a strong commitment to personal and professional development, as well as compliance with organizational requirements.

In addition to training, I actively reviewed the team's work to ensure strict adherence to various risk and control policies. By regularly monitoring our processes and outputs, I promoted a culture of risk awareness and compliance within the team. This proactive approach helped mitigate potential risks and maintain a robust control environment.

To further strengthen our control framework, I periodically reviewed the entitlements of each team member. This involved assessing whether their entitlements aligned with their roles and responsibilities, ensuring that access rights were properly matched to job requirements. By conducting these reviews, we reduced the risk of unauthorized access and maintained a secure working environment.

Actively participating in quarterly risk and control meetings, I engaged in valuable discussions with other team managers. In these forums, I shared best practices and incidents I had encountered, while also learning from the experiences of other managers. This collaborative approach fostered the exchange of knowledge and ideas, enabling us to enhance our risk and control practices collectively.

By prioritizing mandatory trainings, adhering to risk and control policies, and actively participating in risk and control meetings, I demonstrated my commitment to maintaining a strong control environment and promoting a culture of compliance within the team. Moving forward, I will continue to stay informed about evolving risk and control practices, share insights, and apply best practices to further enhance our risk management efforts.
