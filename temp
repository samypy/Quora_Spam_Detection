During the evaluation period, I successfully conducted a comprehensive Skill GAP analysis and presented the findings to my managers. This analysis helped us identify key processes, such as Product Scores, Interactions reports, and interactions feeds, where there were skill gaps. To address these gaps, I implemented a cross-training plan, allowing team members to learn and excel in areas outside their primary responsibilities. This initiative enhanced our team's versatility and ensured a smooth workflow across MIG functions.
Working collaboratively with the team, we generated eight productivity ideas that spanned various MIG functions. These ideas have been prioritized, and we are on track to meet the deadlines for their implementation. In the reporting space, we identified reports that required significant manual effort and successfully automated them. This automation has resulted in significant time savings for the team. Additionally, in the broker votes function, we automated the crowdsourcing adjustments and streamlined the communication with sales, reducing the burden on the team.
I worked closely with the Data Quality group to ensure that all MIG reports adhere to the approved standard MIG guidelines. This involved conducting trainings to familiarize the team with the new MIS style guide, ensuring that each member understands and adopts the guidelines effectively. By aligning our reporting practices with the approved guidelines, we improved the consistency and accuracy of our reports.
Collaborating closely with Shoeb and Mangesh, I gained a deep understanding of the process for creating interactions reports and identified opportunities for efficiency improvements. We added additional summaries to the existing report and ran simulations to optimize the delivery of relevant summaries to regional BUMs within the first five days of the month. Additionally, we are exploring automation options using Python and other available technologies to further streamline the report generation process.
I also collaborated closely with experts within the team to gain deeper insights into the challenges in the readership space. Our focus on data issues led to the establishment of a data gatekeeper responsibility, which proved instrumental in addressing ongoing data concerns. During our review of existing reports, we identified areas where changes in data retrieval methods were necessary to enhance accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, our efforts in this area have yielded significant results. Recently, we identified an issue with our video reads vendor, which could have potentially affected data quality. We have launched a thorough investigation to determine the root cause of the problem and are actively working towards implementing a permanent fix. By identifying and resolving this issue, we aim to ensure that our readership data remains reliable and trustworthy. This proactive approach to data management demonstrates our commitment to continuous improvement and our dedication to delivering accurate and reliable insights to our stakeholders. By addressing data concerns promptly and implementing necessary changes, we can maintain the highest standards of quality in our readership reports and uphold the trust of our clients and partners.
By actively participating in weekly tech calls, I enhanced my understanding of system issues and upcoming enhancements. These meetings have been instrumental in expanding my knowledge of readership data and its various aspects.
While there is still much to learn in the second half of the year, I would like to express my gratitude to Niraj and Shoeb for their valuable support thus far. For the remainder of the year, I will prioritize cross-training initiatives within the team, continue automating manual processes, improve data quality, and foster a unified team spirit to drive us towards achieving our business goals.
By maintaining a focus on these objectives, I am confident in our team's ability to excel and make significant contributions to the success of our business.
