Throughout the first half of the year, I successfully maintained high team morale despite encountering challenging circumstances. Despite the MIG restructuring, cross-training initiatives, and ORP training, the team remained motivated and focused on achieving results. This accomplishment reflects my leadership and communication skills, as I effectively kept the team engaged and committed to overcoming obstacles.

In terms of goal achievement, I consistently adhered to Citi's leadership standards, ensuring that our actions aligned with the organization's expectations. Specifically, in the "We Take Ownership" category, I effectively managed workflow and actively contributed to the successful adoption of the restructuring process. Additionally, my role in identifying the right talent and facilitating cross-training demonstrated a strong sense of ownership and accountability.

I played a significant role in ensuring a smooth transition of processes during the restructuring phase, facilitating seamless operations and emphasizing teamwork. Furthermore, my contributions to the Data Quality program, such as reviewing and implementing changes to the reports produced by the team, showcased my dedication to continuous improvement and expertise in this area.

Under the "We Deliver with Pride" standard, I ensured the timely delivery of various critical reports, including interactions, readership, and publication reports, as well as APLs and analysts Scorecards. I provided full support and assistance in resource management to ensure the successful delivery of the advisory index within the designated timeframe.

Collaboration and partnership were fundamental aspects of my approach throughout the evaluation period, as highlighted by the "We Succeed Together" standard. Active participation in the Operations Rotation Program and effective collaboration with the RAD team demonstrated my versatility and adaptability in different roles and environments. Building productive partnerships with stakeholders and onshore managers fostered successful collaboration and knowledge sharing across diverse geographical areas.

Maintaining compliance and adhering to mandatory policies remained a top priority throughout my work. I ensured that these guidelines were at the center of all my actions, reinforcing a culture of adherence and upholding the organization's standards. Additionally, I prioritized completing all mandatory trainings on time, both for myself and the entire team, to ensure ongoing professional development and adherence to regulatory requirements.

Looking ahead, I will continue to prioritize team morale, adaptability, and seize opportunities for personal and professional growth. Upholding Citi's standards, fostering collaboration, and consistently delivering exceptional results for our clients will remain my primary focus.
